# JavaScript Amazon Clone – Interactive (In Progress)

**Forked from [SuperSimpleDev/javascript-amazon-project](https://github.com/SuperSimpleDev/javascript-amazon-project).**  
This fork focused on adding interactivity, modular structure, and real-world features to the original Amazon-style frontend project.

- Expanding cart and checkout functionality

## ✅ Features Added So Far
- Product quantity selection with `<select>` dropdowns
- Real-time cart quantity updates after adding items
- Dynamic product grid rendering from `products.js`
- Modular file structure for better maintainability

## 🙏 Credits
